## GRAD-TTS : Diffusion Probabilistic Model for Text-to-Speech
The paper GRAD-TTS presented the first acoustic feature generator utilizing the concept of diffusion probabilistic modelling. The main generative engine of Grad-TTS is the diffusion-based decoder that transforms Gaussian noise parameterized with the encoder output into mel-spectrogram while alignment is performed with Monotonic Alignment Search. The model we propose allows to vary the number of decoder steps at inference, thus providing a tool to control the trade-off between inference speed and synthesized speech quality.
